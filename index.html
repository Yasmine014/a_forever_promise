    "2025-09-16": "I felt like you don't hate me today, I will see how far can we go with our love before we get back together, because we will. Not like we used to, because that was really bad, but we will and even if we don't I will accept all the pain and all the hurt that comes with it, and I will be strong and I will wait for no matter how long you feel it is necessary to wait.",
    "2025-09-17": "It is crazy how weak the human being can be. I decide to be autonomous and to accept whatever comes my way but then just a small flu and a high fever are making me wanna fall into your arms and sleep. I try to hold my head up but it makes me nauseous and my eyes are burning like hell and all I wanna do is have a look at you before I close them and get some rest. It's all funny! What a human cares about and what he doesn't care about...\n I didn't care about death but 't3ez aaleya rouhi' when I'm sick and you're not here...\n You throw me away like a piece of garbage but you care enough to bring me medication...\n What a crazy world we're living in. I don't understand it Yasmine, I cannot understand it. And everything is ruined, I see no future but... I know someday I will have you like I have never had you before, someday you're gonna know me and forget about everything and everyone else. These are shattered midday thoughts, where you are a few meters from me but world apart." ,
    "2025-09-18": "Today I was super sick, I coudn't leave my bed in the morning, then I went to the doctoe which only made me sad because you know I hate going to the doctor's alone... Let's not dive into this, it's not like I have an infinite book to write. Well, it's not like you're reading this anyway... At this point I feel like I'm just writing a diary for myself... Well, I spent almost the whole day sleeping with all my body aching, I had a lot of fever so I had a very bad nightmare repeating and I woke up crying every time. You're gonna get mad at me if I tell you what the nightmare was about so I won't, but it was super weird. Well, more importantly, I know you are mad at me for calling you yesterday, but let's admit this, I'm getting better, one week ago I wouldn't just call you for 5min, I would go crazy and come to your neighberhood and end up with a needle in my butt to calm me down. Even though I know you just see it as me bothering you but I personally see it as progress, I see it as me letting go of you slowly which is good because that's what you want even though you went crazy on Tuesday... I'm not letting go of your love but letting go of you and of the person you made me become. I kept thinking a lot about us, and I know exactly why I got all crazy for a period of time, you want me to change but I don't think that would be possible with you unless one big detail changes and I am not ready to discuss it with you and you are not ready to talk to me so it's okay, we keep that thing aala jnab, it doesn't matter. But you know what? at the end of the day I totally understand you letting me go as a lover, but what's been killing me is you giving up on our friendship too. I feel like things coud go much easier if we casually talk because it's been killing me being alone especially at work because I don't wanna talk to anyone either way. Well, that's okay too it will pass and I'm used to loneliness, but people keep asking me about you and stuff, I am energetic and fine until someone brings you up and asks why we don't talk anymore... it makes me fall down during the day because their questions are not innocent and they make me feel like shit. It makes me feel like okay we're not together but we can be friends. Aslan last time when we went out I told you let's just be friends stop teasing me but you keep on doing it until I go crazy then blame me for going crazy... I truly want to and I am able to be your friend if you simply stop teasing me and reminding me of what was between us. Well, I guess it's too late for that too. I believe it was my fault the relationship ended but it was yours the friendship ended because you kept on teasing. My arms are open for a friend if you ever want that. My arms are open for a lover too but not now, it needs a lot of time for me to be sable enough to explain some things and make sure nothing repeats itself. Hmmmm, I have a lot more to say but I'm gonna end it here because my nose is running and I wanna lay down... I love you soooo much but that is something you won't hear or see anywhere else than here, which you're not reading anyway so I will keep it to myself. Good night!" ,
    "2025-09-19": " I was so tired today waiting all day on a step but I kept thinking about you. Hmmmmm I don't know if I should bring up what I'm about to say next I know it bothers you but I will try not to dive into it. Today was the first time someone tells me that you love me... I didn't wanna talk to Jed about you, I always wanna skip that subject because I decided to keep things calm just within me, because people are bad and harsh, one day there with you, one day they're not... and my love for you is so pure that I really need to protect it from all those people and things that made me go crazy for a while... Bon bref, I forgot what he asked me about you so I just said: 'melekher I love her, I will never stop, I will live with it somehow, and I don't wanna talk about this' ah I remembered, he was telling me how I have the right to go see my life so I told him too: 'I just wanted to make things less hard for myself because I thought she did not care, but now I know she does and I would never do something to hurt her even if it makes me lonelier and it makes me dive deeper in sadness...' that's when he told me you know she still loves you so I said :'sadly I didn't know before but yeah, and sadly even though we both do we cannot be together right now but I regret losong her frienship but it's okay, it will pass too.' that was all we said about the subject, but it brought such warmth to my heart that for the first time ever, someone believes you love me. People hurt me a lot by saying that you don't... they always do say that, all of them... I didn't care when we were together, because I trusted you so much with myself and my heart... and also beause I didn't want you to have problems with anyone... but when you left, and they kept saying that, I believed it, because you were not around anymore to make me feel otherwise and I was also in deep shit, all fucked up and filled with negative thoughts either way... I hate listening to people, I hate showing my weakness to them, but I did because my head was not in its place at all... I don't wanna dive deeper into all that until we are back together and we can have a calm conversation where we're not blaming each other but simply understanding what each one of us has been feeling through this hellish torture... There are a million things I wanna tell you about, but not now. You will discover most of them yourself about people sooner or later either way and we will talk about it only when you do. That's why I ask you to be careful... I know the way you are... Even with all your flows, you're still a baby angel and I don't want you to lose yourself or to feel hurt... even though I hurt you a lot, but I have no way right now of explaining to you what it truly meant and why it all happened... maybe by writing thing will unravel slowly... you should know that I never revise or reread what I write here, I just write whatever comes to my mind and oopppaaa put it online magically! Hasilou, I'm glad that we had a coffee today the four of us, we should do that more often, maybe once a week where it's the old vibe, all of us as friends. You know that even with all the fuck ups, the firndship we all have is pure and we shouldn't completely lose that, it's alright if you wanna be around other friends more but you know that nothing will be this pure because we NEVER let our friends down and you're part of us now, don't let me ruin that for you... haya take care of yourself now... Bye Bye!",
    "2025-09-20": "Late on adding the details that I saved on my phone so I will just make it quick and simple as I don't really feel like writing about something that I don't fully understand myself... In general it was a good bad day, I kinda enjoyed my time, it was more peaceful than the past few days even though it was all weird and messy... sometimes you should just shut your mind completely and just do whatever without thinking about it... you're funny when you get drunk I don't know if you remember or not but at the end of the night I was trying to keep you in place because you really wanted to get up and hit someone who spoke to me saying that he likes the way I dance... you were screaming :'ma aandouch l7a9 yhot yedou aala haja mte3i walah ma n9oum nkasarhelou taw... chmaaneha ymesli mart...' bon, you were extra drunk so ena bidi ma 5dhitech aalik but calming you down wasn't that easy. I don't wanna talk about all the other details but thinking back about it all I think is that it was all funny... life kolha aala baadh'ha is simply comedy... all I can say is that zedt 3eft laabed akther which made me more at peace with myself because no matter how much I fuck up, I don't lie to myself or to people, I am me till the end. It is certainly not my place here but I will make a place for myself. I hope you're by my side but even if you're not I'm gonna be fine, I hope you would be too even though I'm sure you will for hard soon. All I wanna say is that I am gonna be here if you do. You will never be alone, you think you're not right now but the day you realize that you are, know that I will be your cushion to fall on, it means nothing but I will be here. Bye",
    "2025-09-21": "Do you know that Sunday is my favorite day of the week? I love lazy Sundays, I love energetic and chaotic Sundays... I just love it, it's calmer even when it's bad... I feel like my head is in it place on Sundays... What about this one? This weird Sunday that starts with sex with your ex? and ends with her not talking to you hahahahaha... well, the sex part is the least important part in all that, we were just fooling around, both of us missing a body that used to be so close, the body that made us feel things we never felt with anyone else... even though it's less special with us not being together but it doesn't matter, the body has its needs and sometimes we just wanna fill it however is possible and idk for you but for me the only possibility is you because I feel ewww about everyone else for now... well, I must admit that you seemed super disgusted with me today, whenever I make a joke or simply just talk you give me a very bad look rolling your eyes at me, that used to make me feel hurt and insecure before like I am not loved or something, but now it doesn't do shit to me, this is me, I am very nice and cool and attractive and I can offer the world to the one I am with even though I have some bad fuck ups but as a human being, no one is better than me. I lose my path sometimes w felekher narjaa wahdi, because this is me, nti7 w n9oum, I'm sorry li kif to7t I showed you that I did... w tellement hassit rouhi nhebek w merteha maak, I showed that side to other people li 7yethom kemla maaya w they never knew that that side existed... So thank you for making me understand that I should keep myself strong even in front of the love of my life... Genre je peux te donner mon tout, sauf cette partie qui me rend vraiment nue devant toi... toi ou quiconque qui va venir dans le futur quand tu ne seras plus là pour de bon... You say I am fucked up, but who isn't? with all my troubles, I know what I want and who I love... Maybe being by myself is much better... it will make me think more and make better decisions in my life... and do whatever I want surtout, loin de toute toxicité... I don't wanna hear what I cannot do anymore, I don't wanna feel like shit because someone is mad at me... I don't wanna feel down and insecure because the person I love is teasing me or fucking around with things that hurt me... I don't wanna lose myself because I am trying to do to you the things that you do to e or the things that you challenge me to do... who the hell are you? why did I wanna prove myself to you that much? I don't need shit from anyone... including you... I love you way toooo much, and I would give you 3inaya if you want to but I do not need to prove shit to you, life is better with you, but it's not the end without you. If you love me you'd come to me, if you don't taw kol youm yzid nebda nensek bechwaya w je passe... The issue is that I allowed myself to get so very attached to you in a hard period which made me feel life you are my whole life... well, you're not... I have a life and if I am willing to I would offer it to you but I don't need you to have one... Maybe it's because when I stopped trying with you, a lot of people came my way in a way or another and it made me realize that oooh fuck I am still a desired person! I don't want anyone else but I understood that I have a lot to give, all I ask for is someone to be so good with me that they keep me happy and calm. I don't want that person to be just anyone, I want it to be you. It kills me that it will probably not be you but with time I will forget, I realized that too late but l mouhem I did... I will wait until I stop wanting you or until someone does to me what you did to me and comes to steal me in a very bold way. After all you left that position open Niahaha. Nah kidding, for now I want you hihi. Bye Bye!",
    "2025-09-22": "There are a million things I have been thinking about lately, some are good, some are bad, some are just a weird mix... some confuse me, some getting clearer... so I don't know what to start with and how I should put them in order... but there's one thing that is confusing me as hell since yesterday... I can't stop thinking about it but it makes me feel a little bit crazy... so Saturday I went back with her to our room, we were both super tired and super drunk, she got changed before me, ofc she's always faster that girl! She lays down on her bed while I get changed then she invites me in her arms... I felt confused chwaya because I thought she only wants some physical fooling around that day, but I missed her much so I threw myself on her chest... I don't know why but I have never felt that way before ever, not even with her... I have never slept like that... I felt like we were two neighbour pieces of a glass puzzle that fit perfectly! I felt like daaaam, that's all I ever wanted, to crawl in a foetus position and find my perfect place... it's not just about the feelings but damn the position was crazy surreal! How the hell can it fit that well? she was cressing my hair and kissing it slowly from time to time then she just put her arms around me as if she's protecting me from everything good and bad... as if she's containing me... I have always said all I need and want is to be embraced, not sex, not kisses, not hugs... but someone embracing me which is a mix of strong feelings and a very sincere very gentle touch... for a moment I was hearing her in my head saying 'I got you, you cannot fall in here, I got you baby girl...' and I have never ever felt that kind of peace and calk and serenity before! Now it makes me feel crazy because come on, it has never been like that with her! she has never been that gentle, that loving, that perfect... she has never given me that feeling that I have been looking for to calm all my stupid conclusions and thoughts about our relationship... if only I got that when it was going bad I would've became a harmless baby melting in her arms... she higged me multiple times before, I slept in her arms before, but never with that feeling! Am I crazy or did something change in her? in me? in us...? is the fact that I feel like I have no security left but myself making me feel that way when she held me? is losing me making her this soft and gentle? or is it the alcohol effect? I honestly hate the last option but it is a possibility still... because after all of all the time we spent together, good and bad, how come she only got that kind of pure gently heavenly touch then? how come that body became a perfectly perfect magical place for me then...? I'm not saying it was bad before, but it was missing something, it was missing that feeling of real protection, protection like of the world was ending... well, it was ending, we were finally ending that day, weren't we? our break up was bad, over messages, very harsh, very unpure, very hurtful, very degrading (even if it wasn't meant to be like that)... but all that mess and unclearness made me feel like crazy, like there's still something between us and I cannot let go of it or live without it... like I have to get her back no matter what... but sleeping in her arms that day made me feel like this is a bautiful goodbye... now I can bury our relationship in peace truly... now I can accept things and move on... now I can cry on my love's grave in my heart which became its graveyard at the end... because it was soft and calm... because it was everything I ever wanted and she has never given me... now I know it meant something for her... for the first time I went back to being a true baby and she was my mother... I cannot describe how much the beauty of that sleep made me able to let you go... before that I have still not accepted the fact that she was gone but damn it, I wanna remember her like that... I wanna forget everything and remember the night she was actually loving me like I need to be loved... the night she killed my demons... the first night with no nightmares... the night I found my place and felt how beautiful it can be, just to leave it right after that... I got a glimpse of what we could have been... which made feel sane for the first time in a while... because at some point it all got mixed in my head... does she love me? is this relationship real? is there truly something for us? and a loooot of much worse questions which all had their reasons to be asked and I should have explained that at that time before it gets fucked up but I couldn't... hmmmm, that's not the subject, what I am here to say is thank you... thank you for making me feel that once before you leave for good... thank you for giving me that memory, for letting me know that I am not crawy and that feeling I've been looking for is real! and I am able to feel it! Allah ghaleb I lived it with the person giving up on me and won't be able to have it again but it exists... so thank you for that... thank you for finally giving me the courtesy I deserved to leave me in such a beautiful way not the fucked up way you left in... now as a lover, I can keep loving you but let you go... I can be calm and watch you live your life or fuck it up or whatever... will it hurt? yes as hell! but it's gonna be fine because you gave me a very precious feeling that will keep me going without you... I still wanna be friends though, but I know that I am finally healing from you... I can finally go like you did too... and finally the things that used to make me feel jealous are now making me part from you even more... now when you tease me, when you say like earlier that you're gonna get some girl, when I see that you've got Tinder on your phone again and you're using it, when we're talking and you're looking at girls and telling me how nice they look, when you touch people, when you sit with bad people who hurt us, when I'm alone and you're laughing with others, when people talk about us to my face, when people say things about my love to u to my face, also when I remember every single thing you used to teased me with and that slowly destriyed me because you never understood how bad it was for me... well, all those things that you to make me jealous, mad, insane... when I see them and feel them now they're somehow making me get further from you... with every single thing that happens I suddenly realize more that at the end you left me... and I should do it too even though I love you more than anyone is this world can imagine... but that's life, that's what you want... I have ni right to force myself on you, or to force you to be careful about the things you do and say to me or to force you understand how much certain things bother be just because I love you way too much... you are a beautiful chapter in my book, and closing it with that night was all the peace I need to be calm and collectd. Now we're slowly becoming just friends... with time you'll give up on my friendship too because I say the truths that you don't wanna hear (just like I didn't wanna listen to u before when you were saying the truth) well, I'm fine with that too... it just needs more time... every day is gonna bring me more calm towards you... I don't think at this pace I'm gonna wait 10 years like I told you to... well, you never know, we may meet by chance in 10 years and get back together... but I won't be waiting... for now you have my heart and shoul and body... it's gonna take time but my body is gonna leave first... followed by soul... then my heart will eventually follow too... I really needed to sit down and think about what the way you held me that night made me feel... but then again maybe it's just the alcohol not you, maybe it's just me being too tired and imagining things... either way it was a beautiful dream and that's what I'm gonna keep... you told me not to say mama to you again, I wanna say it one more time but not like the others, this time I'm saying it to you as if I am your baby daughter... I love you. Good night mama.",
    "2025-09-23": "What a tiring day! I hate the first day of periods, it's all painful and bad. The only thing that makes them better is a partner being next to you, buying you food and chocolate and giving you a period massage then stays in bed with you. Meeeeeeh, mine is different. The new team members need a lot of care and energy... I don't even know the freaking weird process they have and I need to help them with it... everything is messy but I cannot let anyone down... my agents all have their issues... I'm doing my best every day to be human, to not be like the others but that shit is so hard... it would've been much easier to just deal with them as agents and mark them absent and late without trying to find real solutions for them... they're all being super nice and sweet and they are all truly appreciating what I'm doing but idk... I need to do a perfect job and have a perfect image to be able to pass things for them and maintaining that is not easy in this shithole where everyone is checking every single little step you take, they get involved in everything they have visibility on, they don't mind their business at all... idk why I'm writing about that it doesn't matter here... but I guess at this point I'm just writing to myself bech nfaragh 9albi w kahaw since I don't talk to anyone jemla so at least I write to myself like I used to... ah btw, I'm not sorry for what I did this morning, AT ALL, it was just funny for me to be honest and the way you take it is not my problem. And also thank you for the Antafen it saved the day, I took one and stayed in the car in the sun because heat and sweat help it out but they didn't help at all, and then I took a second one and still nothing... I only got better at the very end of the evening but at that point I was too tired from the pain either way... I still forced myself to go to the gym because I promised myself not to stop, it kills time, makes me stop thinking about you and helps me sleep at night... What else do I wanna say? ah, I decided to write about everything from the start, to tell the whole truth about everything, i don't give a shit whether you understand, you get mad, you stop reading, you hate me... whatever, ena nfaragh fi 9albi w enty oumourek.

What I'm hating though is that I'm starting to see you as monsieur et madame tout le monde... even though my heart is super in love with you, but my mind is starting to see you as an ordinary person... you're with them too... you're not too different at the end... which I hate to say that but kinda makes me feel a little bit disgusted with you too... weird shit, because I still love you as hell but I feel like maach nheb nahki maak jemla, maach nheb nchoufek jemla, n7es fi rouhi kol ma bech nchoufek wela bech nahki maak bech nwali nchouf fik kima nchoufhom w bech nwali maach nhebek maybe wela hata ken nhebek mo5i bech ya9t3ek jemla at this point... ken nal9a nfas5ek men hyeti jemla comme si mekech moujouda lin yji le 15 nchouf ken theb tahki w terjaa w you stop being this fake version of you wela le... ken ey we will build something m 0 khater elli fet khayeb barcha... ken le kahaw aad testana meni message fel 3am ken ma ta7ech beya chkoun ykhalini ne7tarmou au point que I don't send you a message per year.
